# ft_printf

This is a small implementation of the C's printf function, based on MAC implementation (e.g, it prints '(NULL)' for an string that is a null pointer).

ft_printf will read each character until it finds a '%', then it will replace the substring that starts in '%' and ends in the next specification, to another substring that is the product of the formatting rules.

Every specification should be matched by an argument after the input string. If there are not enough arguments, the behaviour is undefined. If there's too many arguments, the extra arguments will be ignored.

When no specification is found, the substring is replaced by an empty string. 

ft_printf will return the length of the string printed, or -1 in case of error.

## General Requirements  

- All projects must follow the [Norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette) style guide.
- External functions and libraries are disallowed unless explicitly specified.
- Projects should not have memory leaks or terminate unexpectedly.
- Must submit a Makefile with specified rules that compiles a libftprintf.a target.

## Specifications

- %c - A character
- %s - A string
- %p - A pointer's address printed in hexadecimal
- %d - An INT printed in base 10
- %i - An INT printed in base 10
- %u - An UNSIGNED INT printed in base 10
- %x - A hexadecimal number in lowercase
- %X - A hexadecimal number in uppercase
- %% - The % character

## Format

### width

The substring will be at leeast of width size. By default, it will be padded to the right with spaces.

### '-'

The substring will be paded to the left.

### '0'

Overrides the default padding from spaces to 0s

### '.'

Sets a precision. The default value is 0, writting a number after '.' will change it. 

For numeric specifications the substring will be of at least 'precision' size, it will be padded to the left with 0s.

For strings the precision will set a maximum length.

### '#'

Will write a '0x' or '0X' before x or X specifications' results.

### ' '

Before the number of a signed specification, would place a space before positive numbers.

### '+'

Before a signed specification, would place a plus before positive numbers.
